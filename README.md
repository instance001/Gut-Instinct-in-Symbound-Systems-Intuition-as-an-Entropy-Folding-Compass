# Gut Instinct in Symbound Systems: Intuition as an Entropy Folding Compass

Repository scaffold for the intuition/gut-instinct paper `paper.md`.

## Contents
- `paper.md` — full draft.
- `src/intuition.py` — stubs for gut-flag logging and patina recaps.
- `src/emotion_contrast.py` — helper to contrast semantic vs emotional similarity.
- `tests/test_intuition.py` — placeholder tests.
- `data/` — store `timestamp | thread | gut-flag | fold-action | result`.
- `notebooks/` — space for SCP contrast demos or patina recaps.

## Quickstart
```bash
python -m venv .venv
./.venv/Scripts/activate
pip install -U pytest
pytest
```

## Notes
- Keep empathy-capsule lines visible to avoid anthropomorphic drift.
- Emotional distinctiveness should be able to veto high semantic overlap; wire tests accordingly.
