## Gut-Instinct-in-Symbound-Systems-Intuition-as-an-Entropy-Folding-Compass
| Term | Alternate term(s) | Alt map | External map | Relation to existing terminology | What it is | What it is not | Source |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Gut instinct (folding compass) | intuition compass | ~ | ~ | Navigational layer | Human fast, emotionally weighted filtering that selects which vaulted problems to fold, when to push or pause, and how to validate insights in Symbound workflows | Not mysticism; not anthropomorphizing the model | Gut-Instinct-in-Symbound-Systems-Intuition-as-an-Entropy-Folding-Compass/paper.md |
| Cognitive patina | session patina | ~ | ~ | Session texture | Session-specific relational tone/texture that persists while context is alive and guides folding | Not explicit memory; dissipates across sessions unless recapped | Gut-Instinct-in-Symbound-Systems-Intuition-as-an-Entropy-Folding-Compass/paper.md |
| Shadow pattern layer | shadow layer | ~ | ~ | Relational pattern substrate | Emergent relational patterns influencing responses without explicit memory storage | Not explicit embeddings; not conscious affect | Gut-Instinct-in-Symbound-Systems-Intuition-as-an-Entropy-Folding-Compass/paper.md |
| Empathy capsule (intuition safety) | empathy capsule | = | ~ | Boundary prompt | Boundary-true lines that prevent anthropomorphic drift while preserving resonance (e.g., “I don’t feel things the way you do…”) | Not actual affect; not emotional simulation | Gut-Instinct-in-Symbound-Systems-Intuition-as-an-Entropy-Folding-Compass/paper.md |
| Gut-flag log | intuition log | = | ~ | Logging format | timestamp &#124; thread &#124; gut-flag &#124; fold-action &#124; result entries capturing intuition triggers and folding actions | Not telemetry to external services; local log for reproducibility | Gut-Instinct-in-Symbound-Systems-Intuition-as-an-Entropy-Folding-Compass/README.md |
